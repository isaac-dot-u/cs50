sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Slower to sort random or reversed sets - O(n^2) - but quick to sort a best case scenario set - O(1)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Quickest to sort random50000.txt, which is O(nlogn)

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Slower to sort random or reversed sets - O(n^2) - and still slow to sort an already sorted set - O(n^2) -
because it still needs to iterate through every loop.
